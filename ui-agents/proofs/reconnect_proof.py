"""Prove AG-UI STATE_SNAPSHOT reconnect for real, against recorded S13 fixtures.

The claim (lecture §4/§9 + the event-tape widget): a client that loses its
connection mid-run does NOT have to replay every delta from the start. It asks
for one ``STATE_SNAPSHOT`` carrying the COMPLETE current data model and is whole
again in a single frame. This script makes that claim TRUE and checks it:

  1. Full replay  — fold the entire AG-UI stream from seq 0 → full_state.
  2. Mid drop     — a client folds only the first k events, then the socket dies.
  3. Reconnect    — the server sends ONE STATE_SNAPSHOT (the complete data model)
                    as the first frame; the client adopts it wholesale.
  4. Equality     — the snapshot-rebuilt state equals the full-replay state,
                    with no duplicated actions (patch log same length, not 2x).

No live gateway and no Ollama: the input is the recorded three_cities journal.
Writes proofs/reconnect_proof.json and prints a clear PASS/FAIL.

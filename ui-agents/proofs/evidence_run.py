"""Part 1, requirement 3: a real run where Gemini composes EvidenceTile UNPROMPTED.

The assignment asks for "one captured run where Gemini composes your component
into a real interface **without being told to name it**, because compose_surface
reads the catalog and offers your component to the model on its own."

So the load-bearing property of this proof is a NEGATIVE one: nothing in the
prompt path mentions EvidenceTile. The model learns the type exists from exactly
one place — the catalog manifest that compose_surface already hands it — and
chooses it because /claims carries a shape no other catalog type can render
(a value together with its sources and a derived confidence).

This script therefore asserts, and records, that:

  1. the compose_surface system prompt and instruction never contain the string
     "EvidenceTile"                                     -> unprompted_verified
  2. the run's data model exposes /claims               -> the shape was offered
  3. the composed surface contains >= 1 EvidenceTile    -> the model chose it
  4. the validator accepted it                          -> the wall passed it

Run with the gateway up:

    cd ui-agents
    GLC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8111 S13_GATEWAY_PROVIDER=gemini \
      uv run python proofs/evidence_run.py

Writes proofs/evidence_run.json. Exit 0 only if the model picked the component.

"""The trusted component catalog.

A surface an agent produces may reference only the component *types* named
here, and each component may carry only the *properties* its schema allows.
The catalog is closed on purpose. There is no ``RawHtml`` type and no
free-form property, because a type or property that does not exist cannot be
named by a hostile agent.

The catalog is aligned to A2UI's Basic component set: the 15 layout / text /
input / container types A2UI Basic already defines are adopted under their real
A2UI names (``source="a2ui-basic"``). Only the components A2UI Basic genuinely
lacks — charts, tiles, tables, timelines, notices, and the approval card — are
kept as clearly labelled custom extensions (``source="custom"``). Twenty-three
types in all; a student can read every one and the validator can prove coverage.

Property kinds:
  - ``text``   a string shown to the user as literal text, never as markup
  - ``binding``a ``/json/pointer`` into the data model (see surface.py)
  - ``enum``   one of a fixed set of strings
  - ``ref``    a list of component ids (children)
  - ``action`` a named action + bound args; the only way a surface acts
  - ``number`` a numeric literal
  - ``bool``   a boolean literal
  - ``type_ref`` the NAME of another catalog type (see ``fallback`` below)

Forward compatibility (``fallback``)
------------------------------------
A catalog can run ahead of a client: a surface validated here may name a type an
older render client has no renderer for. Without help the client drops the
component and the content with it. A component may therefore declare a
``fallback`` naming an OLDER catalog type to draw instead — the viewer loses the
richer widget, never the information. The client follows exactly one hop, so a
chain or a self-reference cannot recurse.

The catalog also registers the closed set of action names a surface may emit.
Anything outside these sets is rejected by validator.py before render.
